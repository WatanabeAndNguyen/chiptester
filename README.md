In our VLSI class, we developed a stepper motor driver using Cadence and Synopsys tools. Optionally, we had the opportunity to get our chip fabricated so long we test it upon arrival. Since we decided to fabricated our chip, we had no other choice but to test it.  In order to do so, we designed a circuit on a breadboard to interface with the chip. The input stimulus is generated using a script on a Raspberry Pi. Since the signals on the Raspberry Pi are 3.3V and the chip operates at 5V, we borrowed a breakout board designed by one of our colleagues which includes voltage translators that amplifies the signals from the Pi to 5V.
